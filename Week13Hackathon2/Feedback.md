Project Name: La Calma
Team Members: Ramiro

1. Overall Impression:
This project is far too simple for this stage of the course.

2. Technical Implementation:
Minimal use of node.js.

3. User Experience:
the project lacks a lot of CSS.

4. Strengths:
the project structure is good enough.

5. Areas for Improvement:
I would have liked to see more of everything. More use of database, more complex use of node.js, actual use of the index.html form.

6. Final Thoughts:
The project is a two HTML pages and a quiz. The CSS is subpar, and the JavaScript is non-existant.
